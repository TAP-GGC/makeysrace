# Makey Your Shot

## What is TAP?

The Technology Ambassadors Program is a program that offers students opportunities to learn more about technology, and help them develop creativity, leadership, communication, and teamwork skills. It also gives them the opportunity to do outreach with their projects so that children of all ages can get interested in different technologies. The outreach will help TAP students build their leadership skills and make them gain public speaking confidence.
