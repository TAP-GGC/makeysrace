# Using Scratch to Teach Event-Driven Coding Skills
## About
MaKey MaKey Pool is a fun pool game that uses Scratch programming to teach students basic coding skills such as “if-statements” and “while loops”. The MaKey MaKey circuit board will be used in place of the computer mouse/keyboard mousepad. The project was created by Makey Your Shot, a group of students a part of the Technology Ambassadors Program at Georgia Gwinnett College. The [Technology Ambassadors Program](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program) is a program that offers students opportunities to learn more about technology, and helps them develop creativity, leadership, communication, and teamwork skills, while also giving them the oppurtunity to do community outreach. This project was created with the goal of attracting non-technical people to like and get excited about technology. The students that participate in the outreach events will be able to learn these basic coding skills through demonstrations and hands-on activities (making their own changes to the game).

## Project Description
* Difficulty Level: Medium
* Target Audience: 6th Grade - College
* Duration of workshop: 60-90 minutes
* Needed Materials: MakeyMakey circuit boards, objects to use as input devices for the MakeyMakey
* The project is used to educate others about "if-statements", "while-loops", and block coding by creating a fun pool game using Scratch. 
* MakeyMakey is a circuit board that can use any object as an input device.
* The primary goal of this project is to educate and create interest in the IT field for non STEM majors. 
By engaging in our workshops, students will create a pool game using block coding and using a MakeyMakey as a controller to learn about fundamental coding principles such as "if-statements" and "while-loops".
* The Technology Ambassador Program ([TAP](https://www.ggc.edu/academics/school-of-science-and-technology/research-internships-service-learning/technology-ambassador-program)) at GGC strives to break the misconceptions of the IT field by providing fun workshops for students of all backgrounds. TAP students design engaging and fun outreach workshops to encourage interest in IT and STEM.

#### Results

~~72 students participated in the 2 class workshops. 90% of them were non-IT majors, while 10% were IT majors. Their ages ranged from 18 to 58 years old. Based on the pre-survey results, 30% understood the concept of if-statements, 37% kind of understood the concept of if-statements, and 33% did not understand the concept of if-statements. In regards to while loops, 22% understood this concept, 15% kind of understood this concept, and 63% did not understand this concept. After going through the workshop and taking the post-survey, 82% finally understood the concept of if-statements, 15% kind of understood the concept of if-statements, and 3% still did not understand the concept of if-statements. In regards to while loops, 75% finally understood this concept, 20% kind of understood this concept, and 5% still did not understand this concept. 8 students (6 females and 2 males) actually made changes to the game, and 75% of them were able to understand by making complex changes, while 25% of them partially understood by making simple changes.~~

### MaKey MaKey

1. **Plug in the USB** The small side of USB cable plugs into MaKey MaKey, and the big side plugs into computer.
2. **Close Pop Up Windows** Your computer may ask you to install drivers or do other setup. You can click cancel or close the window.
3. **Connect to EARTH** Connect one end of an alligator clip to "Earth" on the bottom of the front side of MaKey MaKey. Hold the metal part of the other end of the alligator clip between your fingers. You are now "grounded." 
4. **Connect to "Space" and Try It** While you're still grounded, touch the round "Space" pad on the Makey Makey. You should see a green light on the Makey Makey, and your computer will think the space bar was pressed.
5. **Connect to Ports A1-A5** Use one end of your 5 connector wires and connect them into ports A1, A2, A3, A4, and A5 on the back of the MaKey MaKey circuit board. Connect the other ends to your makeshift keys (any household object)
6. **Try It!** You should be able to use your makeshift keys as a substitute for the mouse/keyboard pad.
